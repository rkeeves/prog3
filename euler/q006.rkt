The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  (1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .
3025-385=2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
